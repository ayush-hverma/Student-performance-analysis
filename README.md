# Student-performance-analysis
The student performance analysis project using machine learning aims to evaluate and predict students' academic outcomes based on various data points. Such projects can help educators identify at-risk students, understand factors influencing performance, and implement personalized interventions to enhance learning experiences.
# Objectives:
Predictive Analytics: Predict students' future performance and grades.
Identification of Key Factors: Determine the key factors that influence student performance.
Intervention Strategies: Develop strategies to improve student outcomes based on predictions.
# Tools and Libraries used:
Pandas: DataFrame and Series data structures for handling tabular and time series data.
Matplotlib: Creation of static, interactive, and animated plots. Support for various chart types (line, bar, scatter, histogram, etc.).
Seaborn: Built on top of Matplotlib, offering a high-level interface. Functions for visualizing statistical relationships (heatmaps, violin plots, box plots, etc.).
Scikit-learn: Algorithms for classification, regression, clustering, and dimensionality reduction. Tools for model selection, evaluation, and validation.
Numpy: N-dimensional array objects. Mathematical functions and operations on arrays.
